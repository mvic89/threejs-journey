Fullscreen and Resizing notes

Our canvas current resolution is '800x600' (const = sizes)
Let's fix that and fill the whole available space

-----------------------------------------------
Fit in the viewport
Viewport is the window that shows your screen and the objects inside it.

To get the viewport width and heigt, use 'window.innerWidth' and 'window.innerHeight':
const sizes = {
  width: window.innerWidth,
  height: window.innerHeight
}

It's working but there is a margin on the top and the left, and we can scroll
This is because of the browser default stylings.

-----------------------

Now, we're going to add CSS to the 'src/style.css' file

You can write standard CSS just like you're used to, and the page will automatically reload.

A good thing to do first would be to remove any type of margin or padding on all elements by using a wildcard *:

*
{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

Then, we can fix the canvas on the top left using its webgl class to select it:

.webgl
{
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}

You don't need to specify width or height on the canvas because Three.js is already taking care of that when you call the renderer.setSize(...) method.

This is a good opportunity to fix a small problem on our canvas. Maybe you've noticed a blue outline on it when drag and dropping. This mostly happens on latest versions of Chrome. To fix that, we can simply add an outline: none; on the .webgl:

.webgl
{
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    outline: none;
}

If you want to remove any type of scrolling even on touch screens, you can add an overflow: hidden on both html and body:

html,
body
{
    overflow: hidden;
}

------------------
Handle Resize

To resize the canvas, we first need to know when the window is being resized. To do so, you can listen to the resize event on window.

Add the resize listener right after the sizes variable:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    console.log('window has been resized')
})

Now that we trigger a function when the window is being resized, we need to update few things in our code.

First, we must update the sizes variable:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // Update sizes
    sizes.width = window.innerWidth
    sizes.height = window.innerHeight
})

Secondly, we must update the camera aspect ratio by changing its aspect property:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // ...

    // Update camera
    camera.aspect = sizes.width / sizes.height
})

When you change camera properties like aspect you also need to update the projection matrix using camera.updateProjectionMatrix(). We will talk about matrices later:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // ...

    camera.updateProjectionMatrix()
})

Finally, we must update the renderer. Updating the renderer will automatically update the canvas width and height:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // ...

    // Update renderer
    renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
})

All together:

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
{
    // Update sizes
    sizes.width = window.innerWidth
    sizes.height = window.innerHeight

    // Update camera
    camera.aspect = sizes.width / sizes.height
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix()

    // Update renderer
    renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
})
